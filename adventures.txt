What do you choose? >>> 

You arrive at school, you head to your homeroom and see your friend, but at the same time,
your friend calls you over. You have 2 descicions, either (T)alk to your friend, or (D)o your homework.

While talking to your friend, the Teacher notices you and gets frustrated. Either (S)top talking,
or (K)eep talking.

You decline your friend, and head over to your desk. However, your friend isn't too happy, you can either
(I)gnore him, or (T)alk to him.

After ending the conversation with your friend, the teacher settles everyone down. Your friend signals
you to come over and talk some more. You can either go to (T)alk to him, or (D)ecline.

After you ignore the teacher and keep talking, your teacher gets furious. She tells you to get
out of class, and go to the principal's office. You either (G)o to the office, or (S)kip class.

You stop doing your homework, and head over to talk to him, and the teacher settles everyone down.
You can either (K)eep talking to your friend, or (S)ettle down.

You still don't wanna talk to him, and continue on your homework, but now your friend is really mad.
Either try to (S)ave the friendship, or (L)eave him behind.

You head back to your friend, and discuss something. However, the teacher hates it when you
do something like that, and she makes a phone call home. Your parents are very dissapointed in
you. You lose video games and all devices for the weekend, and now you are grounded. Game Over.

After settling down, your friend decides he'll tell you whatever it is during lunch,
and your day goes on normally. The teacher may have gotten a bit mad, but good job.
You win!

After heading to the principal's office, she gets an email from your teacher and you confess
on what happened. She is very dissapointed in you, and doesn't like it when you do stuff like
that. She appreciates the honesty, and only gives you a warning, your only warning. You head back to class.
Better luck next time. Game Over.

You decide that the principal can wait, and skip class. Little do you know, your teacher reveals
a huge project! Unable to get all the details, you end up turning it in late and you fail.
The grade was so low that you ended up failing that class. Game Over.

Your teacher doesn't appreciate when you ignore her instructions, and tells you to sit down
and gives you a detention. Game Over.

You head to your seat and get ready for class. Your day goes on normally, and you get all the info
on the big project coming up. You Win!

You go over and try to save your friendship, he calls a truce with you and the day ends up being
a pretty normal day. You Win!

You blindside your friend and leave him in the dust. He takes welding, and he has an igniter for
a torch. He lights a thing on fire, and the classroom is now fully on fire, the wooden desks only
contribute more to the flame. The fire alarms sound, and now everyone is trying to pile out. You spot a
door in the back. You can either (W)ait your turn to get out, or (T)ry the back door.

You run to the back door, and open it. It's a black pit below, but you fall in too fast. You hit the ground
with a thud, and have entered the backrooms. Filled with deadly entities, corrupt, infinite levels,
and undiscovered parts. All you do is run, but you're in an infinite office building, and there's no end.
Who know what happens next.

You wait your turn and get out. The school burns a bit but the Fire Department arrives quickly
and the fire is put out. Your belongings are now ash and melted slag, but you are safe. Everything
can be bought or replaced, so you're ok. You win.
